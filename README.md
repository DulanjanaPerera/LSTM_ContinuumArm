# LSTM\_ContinuumArm

This repository contains code for modeling and controlling a continuum robotic arm using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project focuses on mapping between different parameter spaces‚Äîsuch as configuration, pressure, and task space‚Äîusing forward and inverse models, complemented by Bayesian optimization techniques.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### `ConfigToTask`

This module handles the mapping between configuration parameters and task space.

* \`\`: Implements the forward model that maps configuration parameters to task space.
* \`\`: Performs inverse modeling and applies Bayesian optimization to map task space goals back to configuration parameters.
* \`\`: Loads a pre-trained model to validate and test inverse mapping performance.
* **Other **\`\`** files**: Include scripts for dataset generation (both forward and inverse) and the LSTM model class definitions.

### `PressureToTask`

This module focuses on the relationship between pressure inputs and task space.

* \`\`: Develops a forward model using Bayesian optimization to map pressure inputs to task space.
* \`\`: Implements inverse modeling with Bayesian optimization to determine pressure inputs required for desired task space outcomes.
* \`\`: Fine-tunes the inverse model using additional data to improve accuracy.
* \`\`: Tests the system's ability to follow predefined trajectories in task space.
